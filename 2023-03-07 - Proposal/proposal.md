# Narrative and Aesthetics

## Plains Village

A farming community surrounded by fields, with a sturdy town hall made of cobblestone and oak wood. The barracks and archer tower helped them defend against threats. The villagers celebrated with a statue of a white wool horse. They used a minecart to move between the barracks and archer tower.

## Jungle/Forest village

Located deep inside a dense jungle, the villagers built treehouses from jungle wood connected by vines. An archer tower high in the trees helped them keep watch. They had a ceremonial statue of a moawi head for good luck. They used a minecart to move between the barracks and archer tower.

## Snow Tundra village

Surviving in a frozen landscape, the villagers built an underground bunker for barracks. An ice tower with a lookout platform was their archer tower. They had a ceremonial statue of a polar bear made of snow blocks. They used a minecart to move between the barracks and archer tower.

## Desert village

Surviving in a barren wasteland, the villagers built a sandstone pyramid for their town hall. The barracks was made of sandstone and nether bricks, surrounded by lava leaks. An archer tower with a crenelated top helped them keep watch. They had a ceremonial statue of a cobra made of sandstone with lava leaking from the sides. They used a minecart to move between the barracks and archer tower.
